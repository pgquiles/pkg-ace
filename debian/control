Description: An Object-Oriented Network Programming Toolkit in C++
 This package contains the run-time ACE library.
 .
 The ADAPTIVE Communication Environment (ACE) is a freely available open
 source object-oriented (OO) framework that implements many core design
 patterns for concurrent communication software. ACE provides a rich set
 of reusable C++ wrappers and framework components that perform common
 communication software tasks across a range of OS platforms. The
 communication software tasks provided by ACE include event
 demultiplexing and event handler dispatching, signal handling, service
 initialization, interprocess communication, shared memory management,
 message routing, dynamic (re)configuration of distributed services,
 concurrent execution and synchronization.
 .
 ACE is targeted for developers of high-performance and real-time
 communication services and applications. It simplifies the development
 of OO network applications and services that utilize interprocess
 communication, event demultiplexing, explicit dynamic linking, and
 concurrency. In addition, ACE automates system configuration and
 reconfiguration by dynamically linking services into applications at
 run-time and executing these services in one or more processes or
 threads.

Replaces: libace-rmcast5.2c102

Description: A reliable multicast library in C++
 This package contains the reliable multicast framework run-time library
 for ACE.
 .
 ACE_RMCast is a simple, small-scale reliable multicast framework for
 ACE.  The framework is based on the ASX components of the ACE library:
 the protocol is implemented as a stack of interchangeable "modules",
 each one in charge of a very small task.  For example, one module
 implements fragmentation and reassembly, other modules implement
 retransmission, send ACK and NAK messages, and maintain receiver
 membership.
