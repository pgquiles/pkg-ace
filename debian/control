Description: C++ network programming framework
 This package contains the ADAPTIVE Communication Environment (ACE)
 framework.
 .
 It provides platform independent C++ wrappers for interprocess
 communication:
  * signals
  * pipes
  * sockets
  * message queues
  * semaphores
  * shared memory
 as well as thread, process management routines and much more.
 .
 Moreover, it defines patterns for common communication tasks.  Beyond
 these:
  * Reactor, to handle event demultiplexing and dispatching
  * Proactor, for asynchronous I/O driven programs
 .
 Along with the ACE core library, this package contains a wrapper library
 for OpenSSL.

Description: ACE-GUI reactor integration for Qt
 Recognizing the need to write reactor-based GUI applications, the ACE
 community has created several reactor extensions for use with X Window
 System.  Each of these extends the ACE_Select_Reactor to work with a
 specific toolkit.  By using these reactors, your GUI application can remain
 single threaded yet still respond to both GUI events, such as button
 presses, any your own application events.
 .
 The ACE_QtReactor extends both the ACE_Select_Reactor and the Trolltech Qt
 library's QObjects class.  Rather then using select(), the
 QtWaitForMultipleEvents() function is used.
