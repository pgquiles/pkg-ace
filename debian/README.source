This package uses dpatch(1) to manage all modifications to the upstream source.
Changes are stored in the source package as dpatch format diffs, and applied 
from debian/patches at build-time.

To get the fully patched source after unpacking the source package, cd to the 
root level of the source package and run:

	dpatch apply-all

To add new patches, first apply all existing patches, and then run:

	dpatch-edit-patch <patchname>

Dpatch opens a new shell in a copy of the source tree. Edit the files 
appropriately and then exit the shell, and dpatch will generate a file called 
debian/patches/<patchname>. To have new patches applied automatically during 
build and with dpatch apply-all, add <patchname> to debian/patches/00list.

To reverse all patching, run:

	dpatch deapply-all
